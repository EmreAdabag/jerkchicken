# Jerk Chicken Twitter Bot

Columbia Dining does a lot of things well. Jerk chicken is not one of them.

This Twitter bot checks the [dining hall menus](https://dining.columbia.edu/) every morning and reports whether jerk chicken is being served that day. Check out the Twitter page [here](https://twitter.com/CUJerkChicken).
